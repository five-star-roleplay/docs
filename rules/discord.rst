	a) When you are posting content in any text channels make sure it's relevant to said channel, for example, posting in-game advertisements in general chat is wrong it should go under #lifeinvader, another example would be posting clips in the #media channel for opinions, etc. Ensure that the content your posting belongs to the channel you are trying to post it in. If not, do NOT post it. If you are unsure just ask it saves us all time.

	a) Remember to keep it as an argument, it's strictly forbidden to attack someone.

Contacting staff

	a) Reporting a player for breaking a rule can be done throughout our discord server, we have logs that cover far back enough to be able to do a full report a year after it was made so don't freak out if you haven't heard anything back within a few minutes or a few days. It all depends on how backed up admins are and other factors. They'll get to it as soon as possible.
	b) If you evaluate it as an emergency or you simply need an admins input please join the admin waiting channel and one of our admins will move you in as soon as possible.
	c) Channels available for support #in-game-support, #report-a-player, #discord-support
